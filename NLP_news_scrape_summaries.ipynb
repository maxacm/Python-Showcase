            "[<p>It's no wonder the majority of millennials say they <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-social-security-millennials-plan-on-help-from-kids/\" target=\"_blank\">aren't factoring</a></span> Social Security benefits into their retirement planning, for years they've been hearing that the retirement and disability program is going bust. </p>, <p>Their belief is based on projections such as from the most recent <a href=\"https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-2023-trustees-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Social Security Trustees Report</a> showing that Social Security's trust fund reserves will be depleted in 2033. That's one year sooner than the program's trustees had projected last year, and is partly due to shifts such as slowing economic growth.</p>, <p>Yet experts say that some Americans, especially younger workers, have misunderstandings about the impact if the trust fund indeed goes bust — a prediction, by the way, that's by no means a certainty. Even if the trust fund becomes depleted, the Social Security Administration will continue to take in payroll taxes from workers and their employers, allowing the program to pay the majority of benefits, experts note.</p>, <p>The problem, though, is that if the trust fund runs out of money, the program's 67 million beneficiaries will experience a benefits cut. And experts say those cuts could prove devastating to millions of older Americans, disabled people and children who receive benefits. </p>, <p>The impact of the trust fund's projected depletion was highlighted by Social Security Administration's Chief Actuary Steve Goss and Deputy Chief Actuary Karen Glenn on a recent webcast with other actuaries.  </p>, <p>\"At that time [if the trust fund is depleted], there will be an immediate drop in benefits of about 25%,\" Glenn said. </p>, <p>The system is designed to be progressive, meaning that the Social Security benefits paid to low-wage earners represent a bigger share of their earnings. For that reason, it could hit low-income Americans hardest.</p>, <p>Currently, retirees who were low earners while working — defined as earning about $30,000 a year while employed — get about 50% of their income replaced from their Social Security benefits, Glenn noted. But that would drop to about 40% of replacement earnings in 2033 if the trust fund runs out of money. </p>, <p>High earners, or people who paid Social Security taxes at the earnings cap, about $160,000 a year, would see their replacement rate drop from 25% now to 20% in 2033, she said. </p>, <p>\"The question is: Do you consider these benefits adequate?\" Glenn remarked.</p>, <p>The cut would prove more significant for low earners, an issue given that low-paid workers are less likely to set aside retirement funds or save up for old age than higher-income Americans. They're also likely to be more dependent on Social Security for that reason. </p>, <p>The result would likely lead to a spike in poverty rates for older Americans, predicted Nancy Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefits program.</p>, <p>\"Not only would it increase poverty, it would deepen poverty for those already in poverty,\" she noted.</p>, <p>She added, \"You would really have to curtail your expenses. You might have to move; you might not be able to afford rent, and have to move in with someone who can take you in, like your adult children.\"</p>, <p>At the current trajectory, it appears very likely that the Social Security trust fund could run out of money in or around 2033. </p>, <p>But that doesn't mean it will. Lawmakers could make a number of changes that would shore up the trust fund and put it in financial health for 75 years, according to Goss and Glenn. </p>, <p>There are a number of proposals, from Democrats, Republicans and bipartisan committees, that tackle the trust fund's looming crisis. For instance, Republicans have proposed pushing up the <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-medicare-republican-proposal-to-boost-eligibility-age-to-70/\" target=\"_blank\">retirement age to 70</a></span>, effectively cutting between 2 to 3 years of benefits for today's workers — an idea that's not palatable to most Americans, with three-quarters telling an AP-NORC poll they <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/social-security-medicare-cuts-ap-poll-biden-9e7395e8efeab68063d741beac6ef24b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">oppose it</a>.</p>, <p>Other proposals include raising the wage cap on taxes, set at about $160,000 this year. Currently, any income above that amount is exempt from the payroll tax. That means that middle- and lower-income workers shoulder a much bigger tax burden in funding Social Security than the 6% who earn above that amount. <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-benefits-tax-cap-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Raising the income cap</a></span> could go a long way toward shoring up the trust fund, experts say.</p>, <p>Another option is to raise the payroll tax rate slightly, which could also cover some of the solvency issues.</p>, <p>Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, in February <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-amid-republican-threats-to-social-security-sanders-warren-schakowsky-hoyle-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-toincrease-benefits-and-extend-solvency-through-2096/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a bill</a> to address Social Security's looming insolvency. His plan would add $2,400 in benefits each year for retirees, while applying the payroll tax to earnings over $250,000, among other changes. </p>, <p>\"The changes would have led to 75-year solvency,\" Glenn said, citing the Social Security Administration's <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/SandersLetter-2023-0213.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysis of Sanders' plan</a>.</p>, <p>The program has been shored up by lawmakers in earlier eras, which gives the Social Security Administration confidence that the program could be fixed before the 2033 depletion date, Goss said. </p>, <p>\"We are very confident that, as has happened in the past, that Congress and the executive branch will step up and make necessary changes so we won't confront that,\" Goss said. </p>, <p>But, he said, he's hoping the changes occur sooner rather than later. Making changes earlier \"provides more options,\" he noted. </p>, <p>Altman of Social Security Works noted that the crisis facing Social Security has been a talking point for far longer than millennials might realize. She's hopeful that the issues will be fixed, as they have in prior decades.</p>, <p>\"I started working on Social Security in the mid 1970s — I was young and starting my career and I was told I would never get Social Security,\" she noted. \"I was told I was the victim and it was these greedy geezers who wouldn't let benefits be cut.\"</p>, <p>She added, \"Now, I'm 73 years old and I receive Social Security.\"</p>]\n",
            "[<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1928685/sandy-leon/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sandy León</a> has worn many jersey numbers during a long career in Major League Baseball.</p>, <p>To understand the gravity of the No. 12 that adorns the catcher's uniform this season with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Rangers</a>, he has to revisit the worst day of his life.</p>, <p>That was Aug. 18, 2020. León, then playing for Cleveland, had just arrived by bus to the team hotel in Pittsburgh when he called his wife, Liliana, who was at home in Fort Myers, Florida, with their two small children.</p>, <p>He was growing concerned after several unanswered calls. Then he began getting alerts from his home security system.</p>, <p>\"That happens when somebody is making a lot of noise in the house, when the camera gets the sounds,\" León said.</p>, <p>He logged onto an app where he can monitor the cameras in their home. He discovered a horrifying scene with Liliana and their then-15-month-old daughter, Nahomy.</p>, <p>\"My wife was screaming, and she was praying,\" León recalled. \"She was saying words I didn't understand. Then I saw (Nahomy) on the ground. She was purple. She was dead.\"</p>, <p>Little Nahomy had wandered outside and slipped through an open gate to a backyard pool. She fell in the water trying to grab a rubber duck.</p>, <p>When a frantic Liliana discovered her, she was motionless and floating face down in the pool. She jumped in, grabbed the girl and rushed her to the kitchen, where she called 911 while trying to revive her.</p>, <p>Nahomy wasn't breathing. The natural color had drained from her tiny body.</p>, <p>\"She looked black, deeply black,\" Liliana said. \"I tried to open her eyes and it was blank. I don't see her eyes. All the things that I looked on her, she was dying, she was dying, she was dying.\"</p>, <p>Liliana hadn't been trained in CPR, but she tried it anyway. She pressed on Nahomy's chest again and again.</p>, <p>\"I did CPR like five times, but nothing happened,\" Liliana said. \"She didn't do anything.\"</p>, <p>Getting no response, she abandoned her resuscitation efforts.</p>, <p>Needing a miracle, she did the one thing she thought could help.</p>, <p>\"The only one who could do something for her was God,\" Liliana said. \"So, I just prayed. Holy spirit help me. Holy spirit help me. Because I knew that my daughter was dying.\"</p>, <p>She screamed that plea over and over while an ambulance raced to the house. Meanwhile, a terror-stricken Sandy desperately tried to comprehend what he was witnessing on that tiny screen.</p>, <p>Liliana clutched her dying daughter's tiny hand. It was then she noticed a small sign that gave her hope.</p>, <p>\"I started to see in her fingers, at the bottom of her fingers, that it was a little bit pink,\" Liliana said. \"Then all of her body color started to change, and she began to look like a normal, live person.\"</p>, <p>The mother wept as her daughter began showing signs of life.</p>, <p>\"Then she started to breathe,\" she said. \"But it was really, really difficult and really, like, forced.\"</p>, <p>Relief washed over Liliana.</p>, <p>\"In that moment I was like, 'Oh my God it happened,'\" she said. \"'She's alive again.'\"</p>, <p>Paramedics soon rushed in. As they worked on Nahomy, they peppered Liliana with questions about what happened.</p>, <p>The big one: How long was she in the pool?</p>, <p>Liliana didn't know. But she told them there was a surveillance camera they could check.</p>, <p>Nahomy was taken to a hospital, sedated and placed on a ventilator while the water was drained from her lungs.</p>, <p>Still unable to reach Liliana, Sandy talked to a neighbor, who provided scant details.</p>, <p>\"She told me (Liliana) brought her back and then the ambulance came,\" Sandy said.</p>, <p>Sitting in that faraway room in Pittsburgh, Sandy was at a loss.</p>, <p>\"I was having a hard time at the hotel,\" he said. \"I didn't know what to do.\"</p>, <p>Needing help, he called someone from the team. Officials chartered a private jet so he could get to his baby girl immediately.</p>, <p>Liliana was sitting in the hospital room with Nahomy when authorities who saw the video - which the Leóns showed to The Associated Press - came in to talk to her about what they saw.</p>, <p>\"They looked at me with that face that something really, really bad happened,\" she said. \"And they told me from the time she fell, until the time you picked her up was 12 minutes.\"</p>, <p>Twelve minutes.</p>, <p>\"When I heard them say that she was in the pool for that long, I broke down,\" Sandy said. \"I was like, 'She's not coming back.'\"</p>, <p>Doctors warned the family that even if Nahomy awoke, she was almost certain to have brain damage because of how long she was in the water.</p>, <p>They cautioned that she might not be able to walk, talk or do everyday things that people take for granted. The next 72 hours, they said, would be crucial in discovering what toll this had taken on Nahomy.</p>, <p>Sandy arrived in Fort Meyers at about 8 p.m. that night. He was not prepared for what he saw.</p>, <p>\"She was in the bed with all the tubes, and she still wasn't breathing by herself,\" he said. \"It was tough. I didn't know what to do. I went to my wife, and I just hugged her.\"</p>, <p>The couple spent that night in the small room with their little girl as she fought for her life.</p>, <p>A groggy Sandy woke up at 6:30 the next morning and couldn't believe his eyes.</p>, <p>\"I saw my daughter on her knees on the bed,\" he said. \"She's awake. I don't know what happened.\"</p>, <p>By 10 that morning, she was breathing by herself. She started talking immediately when tubes were removed from her throat.</p>, <p>\"She just said: 'Papi you're here,'\" Liliana recalled. \"He said: 'Yes, I'm here baby, with you.'\"</p>, <p>The Leóns were encouraged, but doctors still cautioned that Nahomy could have physical difficulties. But later that day, they removed the remainder of the tubes and put her on the floor.</p>, <p>\"And she started running,\" Sandy said. \"The doctors couldn't believe it.\"</p>, <p>Nahomy spent a few days in the hospital recovering and undergoing tests to make sure she was OK. Everything came back clean, and the family got to go home. The medical team told the Leóns they couldn't explain Nahomy's recovery. A few called it a miracle.</p>, <p>She's perfectly healthy now and has no lingering effects from the harrowing experience. She'll turn 4 later this month and revels in being a girly girl, loving anything that's pink or sparkly.</p>, <p>\"She really likes to think she is a princess,\" Liliana said. \"She really loves her dad. She's a daddy's girl. And she loves to sing, dance. She is a normal girl.\"</p>, <p>The Leóns shared their story with the AP before news this weekend that the 2-year-old daughter of Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Shaquil Barrett <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shaquil-barrett-daughter-drowns-pool-arrayah-tampa-bay-buccaneers/\" target=\"_blank\">drowned in a swimming pool at the family's home</a></span>.</p>, <p>Last year, several family members were reminiscing about what happened to Nahomy and her remarkable recovery in a group text. Someone suggested to Sandy - a journeyman catcher who has now worn seven different numbers with six teams - that he change to No. 12 to mark that interminable time she spent in the pool.</p>, <p>It wasn't available last year in Minnesota. But when he joined the Rangers this season, he finally got the number that means so much to his family.</p>, <p>And each time he buttons up that jersey and puts the No. 12 across his back, he says a little prayer to give thanks that the number didn't take his beloved Nahomy away.</p>, <p>\"I feel blessed and grateful every time I go onto the field knowing that she's normal and nothing happened,\" he said. \"She has no idea, but it's so special for me.\"</p>]\n",
            "[<p>Recent <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/first-republic-bank-second-largest-bank-failure-in-us-history-seized-sold-to-jpmorgan-chase/\" target=\"_blank\">turmoil in the banking industry</a></span> may have you worried about your money.</p>, <p>Shares of PacWest, a small regional bank based in Los Angeles, <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bank-stocks-today-pacwest-western-alliance-first-republic-silicon-valley-bank/\" target=\"_blank\">plunged almost 40% Thursday</a></span> after the company confirmed it may put itself up for sale. Anxiety over potential bank runs has sent shares of smaller banks tumbling. A bank run is when large numbers of people withdraw their money from a bank all at once.</p>, <p>Since March, three regional banks have failed — Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. If the recent bank collapses have you worried about the safety of your money, here's what you need to know:</p>, <p>Yes, if your money is in a U.S. bank insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/brochures/deposits-at-a-glance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</a> and you have less than $250,000 there. If the bank fails, you'll get your money back.</p>, <p>Nearly all banks are FDIC insured. You can look for the FDIC logo at bank teller windows or on the entrance to your bank branch.</p>, <p>Credit unions are insured by the <a href=\"https://ncua.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">National Credit Union Administration</a>.</p>, <p>If you have over $250,000 in individual accounts at one bank, which most people don't, the amount over $250,000 is considered uninsured and experts recommend that you move the remainder of your money to a different financial institution, said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Investopedia</a>, a financial media website. </p>, <p>If you have multiple individual accounts at the same bank, for example a savings account and certificate of deposit, those are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. (Read on for more about how joint accounts are protected.)</p>, <p>Federal officials have been taking steps to make sure other banks aren't impacted.</p>, <p>\"People who have their money in insured accounts have nothing to worry about,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. \"Simply make sure that deposits fall within the guaranteed limits, whether it's FDIC or the credit union equivalent.\"</p>, <p>Customers of banks that have been sold will have access to their money from the new owner, according to the FDIC. For example, JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank when it failed earlier this week and customers are able to access all of their money from JPMorgan. </p>, <p>If you are worried about your bank closing in the near future, there are some things you can watch out for, according to Silver:</p>, <p>— If it is publicly listed, watch the stock price. </p>, <p>— Keep an eye on the quarterly and annual reports from your bank. </p>, <p>— Start a Google alert for your bank in case there are news stories about it. </p>, <p>You want to make sure you pay close attention to the way your bank is behaving, Silver said. </p>, <p>\"If they're trying to raise money through a share offering or if they're trying to sell more stock, they might have trouble on their balance sheet,\" said Silver. </p>, <p>Public companies, including banks, do sell shares or issue new ones for various reasons, so context matters. First Republic did so this year when the hazards it faced were well known, and it kicked off an exodus of investors and depositors. </p>, <p>If you have more than $250,000 in your bank, there are a few things you can do:</p>, <p>— Open a joint account</p>, <p>You can protect up to $500,000 by opening a joint account with someone else, such as your spouse, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bankrate</a>. </p>, <p>\"A married couple can easily protect a million dollars at the same bank by each having an individual account and together having a joint account,\" McBride said. </p>, <p>— Move to another financial institution</p>, <p>Moving your money to other financial institutions and having up to $250,000 in each account will ensure that your money is insured by the FDIC, McBride said. </p>, <p>— Do not withdraw cash</p>, <p>Despite the recent uncertainty, experts don't recommend withdrawing cash from your account. Keeping your money in financial institutions rather than in your home is safer, especially when the amount is insured.</p>, <p>\"It's not a time to pull your money out of the bank,\" Silver said. </p>, <p>Even people with uninsured deposits usually get nearly all of their money back.</p>, <p>\"It takes time, but generally all depositors — both insured and uninsured — get their money back,\" said Todd Phillips, a consultant and former attorney at the FDIC. \"Uninsured depositors may have to wait some time, and may have to take haircut where they lose 10 to 15% of their savings, but it's never zero.\"</p>, <p>Historically, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the FDIC says it has returned insured deposits</a> within a few days of a bank closing. The FDIC will either provide that amount in a new account at another insured bank or issue a check.</p>, <p>If you have a <a href=\"https://edie.fdic.gov/fdic_info.html#06\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">joint account</a>, the FDIC covers each individual up to $250,000. You can have both joint and single accounts at the same bank and be insured for each. </p>, <p>So if a couple each has individual accounts and a joint account where they have equal withdrawal rights, they can each have up to $250,000 insured in their single accounts and up to $250,000 in their joint accounts. That means each of them will have up to $500,000 insured.</p>, <p>Customers should take a close look at the types of investments they have in their bank to know how much of their assets are insured by the FDIC. The FDIC offers an <a href=\"https://edie.fdic.gov/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator</a>, a tool to know how much of your money is insured per financial institution. </p>, <p>FDIC deposit insurance covers:<br/>— Checking accounts <br/>— Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts <br/>— Savings accounts <br/>— Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs) <br/>— Certificates of Deposit (CDs) <br/>— Cashier's checks <br/>— Money orders <br/>— Other official items issued by an insured bank</p>, <p>FDIC deposit insurance doesn't cover:<br/>— Stock investments <br/>— Bond investments<br/>— Mutual funds<br/>— Life insurance policies?<br/>— Annuities<br/>— Municipal securities <br/>— Safe deposit boxes or their contents<br/>— U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, or notes<br/>— Crypto assets</p>, <p>Both <a href=\"https://mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/credit-union-different-than-a-bank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">credit unions</a> and banks allow customers to open savings and checking accounts, among other financial products. </p>, <p>The key difference is that credit unions are not-for-profit institutions, which tends to translate into lower fees and lower balance requirements, while banks are for-profit. Sometimes it also means that it's easier for credit union customers to be approved for loans, McBride said. </p>, <p>Usually, customers are allowed to join credit unions based on where they live or work.</p>, <p>Credit unions serve a smaller number of customers, which also allows for a more personalized experience. The tradeoff is that banks tend to have larger staff, more physical branches and newer technology. </p>, <p>When it comes to the safety of customer's money, both banks and credit unions insure up to $250,000 per individual customer. While banks are insured by the FDIC, credit unions are insured by the <a href=\"https://mycreditunion.gov/share-insurance-estimator-home\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCUA</a>.</p>, <p>\"Whether at a bank or a credit union, your money is safe. There's no need to worry about the safety or access to your money,\" McBride said. </p>, <p>The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Referring to Carroll, Trump said, \"It's Marla,\" referring to his second wife, Marla Maples.</p>, <p>\"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife,\" he said, before being corrected, and told it was Carroll.

Jennifer Love said she worked in a sexist work environment that often felt like a boys' club, according to the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOpI7510iHYcHhyzFM8PQrnXxJ9bOAQr/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Prosecutors said the investigation is focused on NFL corporate offices in New York and Los Angeles, where more than 1,000 employees work.</p>, <p>Attorneys general from both states said they've subpoenaed the NFL for documents about possible violations. Prosecutors are asking for copies of the league's policies on workplace discrimination as well as any correspondence about what happens to employees after they've filed a grievance to managers and human resources, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. The NFL has 60 days to produce the documents, Bonta said.</p>, <p>\"This is the first set of requests and it may not be the last,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I wish it would take mere months, but it should be at least a year.\"</p>, <p>Bonta said one of the major thrusts of the investigation will be finding out if men and women in the same roles are being paid unequal wages. </p>, <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorneys-general-james-and-bonta-launch-investigation-national-football-leagues\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that her office will \"ensure the NFL is held accountable.\"</p>, <p>The NFL defended its workplace practices, while saying in a statement that it plans to \"fully cooperate with the attorneys general.\"</p>, <p>\"These allegations are entirely inconsistent with the NFL's values and practices,\" the league said. \"The NFL offices are places where employees of all genders, races and backgrounds thrive.

NHTSA also has a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recall lookup tool</a> on its website.</p>, <p>\"These vehicles are 17 to 22 years old, and the risk to vehicle occupants is dire,\" NHTSA said in a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/bmw-takata-recall-do-not-drive-warning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Thursday. \"These are some of the oldest Takata air bags under recall and have an extremely high probability of failure during a crash.\"</p>, <p>Since 2009, the exploding air bags made by Takata have killed at least 33 people worldwide, <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/third-exploding-takata-air-bag-death-confirmed-owners-urged-to-get-repairs/\" target=\"_blank\">including 24 in the United States</a></span>. About 400 air bag injuries have happened in the U.S.</p>, <p>The BMW recall comes a couple months after other automakers recalled their vehicles for the same Takata-produced air bags. Safety officials earlier this year told drivers of older Honda, Ford and Stellantis vehicles with Takata inflators <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/us-tells-owners-to-park-old-hondas-until-air-bags-are-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">not to drive them</a></span>. Honda said it has already replaced 99% of the dangerous inflators.</p>, <p>\"These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50% chance of rupturing in even a minor crash,\" NHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consumer-alert-honda-upgrades-takata-alpha-recall-do-not-drive-warning-targeting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in February. \"Don't gamble with your life or the life of someone you love  — schedule your free repair today before it's too late.\"</p>, <p>Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags pushed Takata Corp. of Japan <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dodge-chrysler-do-not-drive-air-bag-death-takata/\" target=\"_blank\">into bankruptcy</a></span>.</p>]\n",
            "[<p>Some consumers who used Intuit's TurboTax could get up to $85 each as part of a 50-state settlement over the software maker's tactics that allegedly tricked consumers into paying for tax services that should have been free.</p>, <p>Under the settlement, Intuit must suspend its \"free, free, free\" ad campaign that promised free tax prep, but actually charged many consumers for the service, <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-secures-141-million-millions-americans-deceived-turbotax\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to a Thursday statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. </p>, <p>The <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intuit-turbotax-141-million-free-paid-products/\" target=\"_blank\">$141 million settlement</a></span>, which also includes residents in Washington, D.C., stems from a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2019 ProPublica report</a> that found Intuit relied on deceptive tactics to <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turbotax-h-r-block-tax-software-overcharged-14-million-file-free-irs-inspector-report/\" target=\"_blank\">steer low-income tax filers</a></span> away from federally supported free services for which they qualified and into a product that charged a fee to file tax returns. </p>, <p>\"Today, every state in the nation is holding Intuit accountable for scamming millions of taxpayers, and we're putting millions of dollars back into the pockets of impacted Americans,\" James said in the Thursday statement.</p>, <p>In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Intuit said, \"Intuit is pleased to have reached a resolution with the state attorneys general that will ensure the company can return our focus to providing vital services to American taxpayers today and in the future.\"</p>, <p>Here's what to know about the settlement.</p>, <p>About 4.4 million consumers across the U.S. are eligible for the payment, according to the statement. </p>, <p>People who qualify to receive a payment are TurboTax customers who used the product in the 2016, 2017 or 2018 tax years and were also eligible to use an Intuit IRS Free File Product. </p>, <p>Eligible customers also must have begun their tax returns using a TurboTax Free Edition Product but then have been informed that they were ineligible to use that product, and thus paid for a TurboTax product. Consumers must also have not used the IRS Free File Product in a previous tax year. </p>, <p>For the 2016 tax year, IRS Free File was <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/use-irs-free-file-to-file-taxes-for-free\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> for taxpayers who made $64,000 or less.</p>, <p>You don't need to do anything, according to the settlement website. </p>, <p>If you are eligible, you should receive an email from the settlement fund administrator that informs you of the approximate amount of your payment. </p>, <p>Payments will be mailed throughout May, the site says.</p>, <p>The payment is based on the number of years a consumer used the TurboTax product and whether they qualify. </p>, <p>Most consumers will receive between $29 and $30, the site says, although some individuals who filed for all three of the years covered by the settlement could get about $85, the New York attorney general said. </p>, <p>A multi-state investigation found that Intuit used \"several deceptive and unfair trade practices that limited consumers' participation in the IRS Free File Program,\" according to the New York AG's statement. </p>, <p>For instance, Intuit used similar names for its commercial \"freemium\" product and the IRS Free File service, and it also blocked its IRS Free File landing page from search engine results in the 2019 tax filing season, the investigation found. That effectively shut out people who were eligible for the free file program from using the service, the statement said.</p>, <p>Free File, a partnership between the IRS and commercial tax-preparation companies, should allow about 70% of U.S. taxpayers to file their tax returns for free, but less than 3% of taxpayers used Free File in the 2020 tax year, IRS figures show. </p>, <p>Intuit stopped participating in the IRS Free File program in July 2021.</p>, <p>The settlement website notes that while payments are being mailed in May, some people may not receive their checks until June. If you haven't received your check by mid-June, you can visit the <a href=\"https://agturbotaxsettlement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settlement site</a> and ask for a payment to be reissued. To do that, you'll need the claimant ID number from the email that you received. </p>, <p>\"Please check back in mid-June if you need to request a reissue, after all checks have been mailed,\" the site says.</p>]\n",

            " Martha Stewart is in mourning after her four dogs mistakenly attacked and killed one of her beloved cats, Princess Peony. The 80-year-old celebrity businesswoman shared the news on Instagram Sunday with a photo of a grave being dug out by workers. “burying the beautiful and unusual Princess Peony,” Stewart wrote. “the four dogs mistook her for an interloper and killed her defenseless little self. i will miss her very badly. RIP beauty.” Shortly after her announcement, Stewart shared another Instagram post of the 12-year-old calico Persion cat's close-up shot on Instagram. “this was the Princess Peony,” she wrote. She shared the same photo on her Instagram Stories, captioned: “RIP beauty cat Princess Peony!!!” Alongside her twin sister, Empress Tang, Princess Peony was born on May 11, 2009, according to Stewart's website. The cats were both moved to Stewart’s farm four months later. \n",

            " Think of a Premier League referee and for many the first thought will be of one man. For the past 22 years Mike Dean has been one of the most recognised officials in the game - for good and bad reasons. He has been at the centre of many controversial decisions over the years, but is also renowned for his amusing facial expressions and flamboyant behaviour on the pitch. After more than two decades as a top-flight referee, Dean will hang up his whistle at the end of the season. The 53-year-old spoke to Football Focus about starting out, his favourite games, players he was \"in awe\" of and the manager he found toughest to deal with. Dean took his first steps towards becoming a professional referee in the 1980s, shortly after leaving school. \"I started in 1985 when I finished school and put on loads of weight and didn't have a job for six months,\" he told the BBC's Mark Chapman. \"I thought about what I could do to keep fit. I like football. I was a goalkeeper, not the most mobile of people. I was 18 or 19 stone when I left school. \"I sorted myself out fitness-wise and did a bit of refereeing, went from there to the local leagues and was then lucky enough to get to the Football League in 1995.\" In those early years, refereeing was not a full-time job and Dean combined his passion with working at a chicken factory. \"I was up at half four and in work for 5am,\" Dean said. \"I finished my shift at 2pm and then I'd get in the car, maybe drive to Carlisle to referee, then get home for 3am and then be back up at 5am for work. \"It was tough but I wouldn't change it. I've just loved football from forever.\" Dean progressed from refereeing in the Football League to becoming a Premier League official in 2000. Known these days for his confidence, Dean admits he was \"in awe\" of some players during his early years. \"You had massive, big-personality players, the [Roy] Keanes, people like that, [Patrick] Vieira - they were all around then,\" he said. \"For me to come from the Football League to the Premier League and referee those players... it was just a massive step. \"I was a bit nervous and a bit scared of making a decision.\" Those nerves appear to have gone and Dean has rarely appeared afraid to make some of the big decisions, no matter whom they upset. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was famed for his hairdryer treatment of players and would also not shy away from giving his thoughts on a referee's performance. Dean had plenty of run-ins with the Scot, but is adamant he was rarely as angry behind the scenes with officials. \"He used to get a lot of stick saying he'd come in and bang the door down,\" Dean said. \"He would come in now and then to express his views if something had gone really badly, but he wasn't as bad as people made him out to be.\" Instead it was a long-time rival of Ferguson on the touchline whom Dean found the most intimidating person to deal with. \"It has to be Arsene [Wenger] when he was at Arsenal,\" said Dean. \"I always found it tough, not refereeing Arsenal in general but refereeing Arsenal when he was the manager. It was just his presence - he wanted the best for Arsenal all the time and if he could get any way of getting one over you he would do. \"Since he has finished football I have seen him and he has been great. Cross the white line and everyone is different, like referees. We are normal people.\" It is not just managers and players who are angered by refereeing decisions, but supporters too - and sometimes the abuse goes too far. In February 2021 Dean sent off West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek in the closing seconds of a draw with Fulham. Dean had been asked by the video assistant referee to check on the pitchside monitor before sending off Soucek for elbowing Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic in the face. \"My daughter got death threats,\" said Dean. \"They were saying they knew where we lived and they were going to petrol bomb the house. It was pretty bad. \"I told the Premier League; they got the police involved. I reported it to the police and they came around. \"My family was affected pretty badly for a couple of weeks. I just took myself off games as I wasn't in the right frame of mind. \"I am a pretty strong person at times. I can be weak at other times. I had to be strong for the family that week. It was tough. \"I had West Ham four weeks later and I was surprised to get it so soon. I apologised to Soucek but he came over and was great.\" Dean looks back on his career with fondness and says he will \"miss it terribly\" next season. Asked about his proudest achievement, he said: \"To be at the top for 22 years. Players can be at the top for 22 years - not many but some. I have kept myself in pretty decent shape. \"To be in the position I have been in for that long and refereeing the best lot of football ever, having the best seat in the house every week and not having to pay for it... it is ideal. \"I don't know what I'll be like in August.\" VAR: \"When it first came in I used to hate it. I had a run-in with the bosses about it. It wasn't for me. I had refereed by then for 19 years without someone in my ear telling me what to do. \"I have found in the past two or three years it has helped me 100%. I'd rather be sent to the screen and make the right decision than make the wrong decision and drive home and be battered in the press.\" Favourite game: \"Manchester City versus QPR has to be [when City won the title in 2012]. Bearing in mind what was at stake, I don't think it will ever happen again - team winning on goal difference with the last kick of the match.\" Booking Sergio Aguero for his celebration in that game: \"Unfortunately it had to be done. [If he was already on a yellow card] I'd have totally not done it. I'd have told the bosses 'think of the bigger picture'.\" Favourite player to referee: \"The likes of Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Vieira. That was a good time to be involved in football.\" \n",

            " Does knowing where our food comes from matter? \n",
            " \"My parents were coffee growers, I am a coffee grower, I have known how to handle coffee since my birth,\" says Faustin Mulomba, from Bweremana in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Mr Mulomba has spent most of his life working in coffee cultivation, but last year was put in charge of a coffee-washing station for the AMKA co-operative, a group of more than 2,000 farmers close to Lake Kivu. Here, beans from farms across the region have their outer skin and pulp removed. They are washed, sorted and dried, before being sent to the city for further processing. Up to 120,000kg of coffee cherries pass through his station in a year, which amounts to a little less than a container full of green coffee beans. While Mr Mulomba's family has a long history in coffee production, the introduction of new technology has changed the way he looks at the business. Now, when beans from his co-operative are sold to Nespresso, the company uses sophisticated data capturing and storage methods - including blockchain technology - to track the beans as they move from the farm to the customer. Blockchain is a digital ledger, or a log, of transactions. The information is distributed and stored among a network of users. The idea behind using the ledger is to make the information easy to verify, but difficult to manipulate. In practice, Mr Mulomba uses a simple smartphone app to scan QR codes that give him information about a particular bag of coffee, such as the weight and pulping data. For Mr Mulomba, the new tech means he can see how much coffee has been produced in the co-operative, where the coffee is and if it has been handled correctly. \"It is a good tool because [...] it allows us to measure, or to have all the quantities supplied to the co-operative in real-time,\" he says. Nespresso partnered with Australia-based start-up, OpenSC, a technology firm that specialises in food traceability. OpenSC has also worked with Austral Fisheries, using global-positioning system (GPS) data and sensors on fishing boats, to ensure vessels are not fishing in marine protected areas. Chief executive and co-founder, Markus Mutz, says this system is a better than the alternative - manual spot-checks carried out by officials. \"Why would you trace something [in the first place] unless there's something about it that you can be proud of, or that is valuable?\" he explains. Retaining continuous data from the source of production can help improve the entire production process - preventing losses and bad practices. But such tracing is not without its challenges. Like any process that requires a database, the quality of the information being fed-in is critical to its success. For instance, back in DR Congo, when coffee is harvested at night, there can be connection problems and delays in capturing the data. Fairtrade International's Director of Global Impact, Arisbe Mendoza, says tracing technology unlocks opportunities for monitoring and supporting fair treatment and pay for workers across the supply chain. The organisation would like to see more traceability in international trade. Yet, she echoes Mr Mulomba's concerns, Ms Mendoza says: \"My experience for some of the initiatives that we have had in the system is that technology is not the issue, it is the capacity building that we need to do behind this to ensure that producers and everyone in the supply chain who will be using these tools, is understanding and able to use it fully.\" She says producers and farmers need to have full access and use of the data in the supply chain, to negotiate prices, prove compliance, and access markets. But often this is not the case, or data rights are unclear. \"Producers might have access to information, but not necessarily the rights to it. We need to ensure that they own the data, then they also can make use of the data anyway they want.\" Sara Eckhouse, executive director of FoodShot Global, a food system investment platform, says not being able to trace food fuels consumer distrust and can even perpetuate bad labour practices, or lack of sustainability. However, she is concerned that the costs and logistical difficulties of traceability will end up being pushed back to the producers. She also cautions that adding marketing around traceability to products could be more confusing than helpful for shoppers - who are already faced by a variety of supposedly sustainable labels. \"If each company is still going to have their own standards that they're verifying for, and if there's no uniform standard or expectation that everybody is meeting a minimum, you could still have companies making claims like 'blockchain verified sustainable', but what does that actually mean?\" More technology of business: Shalini Unnikrishnan, is managing director and partner at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which supports a variety of projects working on food tracing, including at OpenSC. She says consumers are increasingly willing to change their food shopping habits for more sustainable products, including paying more money for certain items. Mrs Unnikrishnan adds that while across the so-called 'digital agriculture' sector, there are lots of small exciting companies and pilots popping-up, policy frameworks are needed to scale these businesses up. \"I think regulation standards are really fundamental to make sure that the changes happening, are happening at scale,\" she says,  because these provide companies, farmers and buyers \"a signal of what is required and a framework for standards.\" So, what do customers think? German management consultant, Thomas Kunze, is a coffee lover who enjoys buying locally-sourced beans on his international travels. Quality and sourcing from interesting locations is important to him. He recently bought some limited edition coffee pods that display the traceability tool. When Mr Kunze scans the package's QR code, he sees which area, or cooperative, his coffee came from, including the profiles of some of the farmers and whether they have been paid for their produce. \"It is interesting but not important,\" he says about seeing the journey his brew took. \"Traceability is nice to see but, because I don't know anything about the different locations, I would need more information about the steps and locations.\" Back in DR Congo, Mr Mulomba cheerily invites coffee drinkers to visit. \"It is very important that the consumers render us visits, [then] maybe they will know our reality on the ground.\" \n",

            " Trump's Truth Social app branded a disaster \n",
            " In October, Donald Trump announced he was planning to launch a revolutionary technology company. \"I created Truth Socialâ¦ to stand up to the tyranny of big tech,\" he said. \"We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter yet your favourite American president has been silenced.\" The app launched on Presidents' Day, 21 February, but six weeks later is beset by problems. A waiting list of nearly 1.5 million are unable to use it. Truth Social looks a lot like Twitter, which banned Mr Trump from posting on the platform after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol on 6 January, 2021. Twitter contended that Donald Trump, by making false claims the presidential election had been \"stolen\", had incited violence. He was banned for life on 8 January, 2021. Truth Social might look like Twitter, but it isn't available on Android phones, web browsers or, apparently, to most people outside the US. \"It's been a disaster,\" Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics, said. And a Republican ally of Mr Trump's, who did not wish to be identified, said: \"Nobody seems to know what's going on.\" On 21 February, Truth Social was one of the App Store's most downloaded apps - but many who downloaded it were unable to use it. There was an assumption this problem would soon be resolved and Mr Trump would start posting his \"truths\" in the coming days - but neither of those things happened. My attempt to register, this week, was placed at number 1,419,631 on the waiting list. While YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook are among the 10 most downloaded apps, according to Similar Web, Truth Social is outside the top 100. Users who find their way in can find the app a little empty, as many big voices on the American right have so far stayed away. Another study found downloads have fallen by as much as 95%. And many are feeling frustrated. \"Signed up for Truth Social a couple weeks ago and still on a waiting list,\" one Twitter user said, on Tuesday. \"By the time I'm off the waiting list and on to Truth Social for real, Trump will be President again,\" joked another. Truth Social chief executive Devin Nunes said its goal was to be \"fully operational\" by the end of March. But quite why the app is having so many problems has baffled experts. Some have pointed to Truth Social's partnership with Rumble, a video-sharing platform that looks a bit like YouTube. Popular with conservatives and the far right, Rumble was supposed to provide a \"critical backbone\" for the site's infrastructure. But if Truth Social is having server problems, why has it taken so long to fix? \"It should take a few days to fix, not six weeks,\" a Republican source close to Mr Trump said. \"There's always going to be hiccups at the beginning - but at this point, I would have thought it would have been resolved. \"Nobody seems to understand why.\" Mr Trump is said to be furious, asking why more people are not using Truth Social. He has about 750,000 followers but has not posted a \"truth\" for well over a month. \"Maybe they're holding him back,\" Mr Tucker said. \"That's his last chance to launch it - when suddenly Trump comes in and starts being really active on it, that will get a buzz.\" Much maligned, Truth Social could still rival competitors such as Gab and Gettr. Mr Trump retains star quality and any \"free speech\" app would bend over backwards to have him on its platform. But at the moment, Truth Social has become a little embarrassing. A platform supposed to stand up to Silicon Valley's heavyweights has barely been able to get to its feet. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

            " Grammy awards go to Olivia Rodrigo and Jon Batiste \n",
            " Olivia Rodrigo, Silk Sonic and jazz musician Jon Batiste have shared the top honours at the 64th Grammy Awards. Batiste's uplifting soul record We Are won album of the year, while Rodrigo won best new artist and best pop album. Silk Sonic's soul throwback anthem Leave The Door Open took home both the record and song of the year prizes. Apart from the awards, the ceremony saw a tribute to Foo Fighters star Taylor Hawkins, and a video plea from Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. In a pre-taped message, he urged musicians to \"fill the silence\" left by Russian bombs \"with your music\". \"Tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks and TV. But not silence.\" His speech was followed by a performance by John Legend, accompanied by Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton; and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. The ceremony, held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, also saw energetic performances from Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish and BTS, while folk icon Joni Mitchell made a rare on-stage appearance to introduce Brandi Carlile. This year's Grammys presented one of the most open fields in years, with the \"big four\" categories expanded to include 10 nominees each. But the Recording Academy tends to favour artists who acknowledge their musical heritage - a factor that undoubtedly helped Silk Sonic and Jon Batiste win their respective categories Batiste's album, We Are, is rooted in black music tradition, from the New Orleans jazz he grew up with, to the classic soul of Al Green, via modern R&B. The title track was written in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 - and the album's themes of positivity and intergenerational wisdom made it a favourite with voters, who awarded Batiste 11 nominations heading into this year's Grammys. Silk Sonic, a joint project between Bruno Mars and rapper/drummer Anderson .Paak, plough a similar furrow. Their sumptuous ballad Leave The Door Open is steeped in the 70s soul sounds of acts like The Chi-Lites and Earth, Wind & Fire, delivered with a knowing wink to modern sensibilities. The duo were clearly delighted with their double victory in song of the year and record of the year. \"We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,\" said Paak, \"but in the industry, we call that 'a clean sweep'. \"To all the other nominees... the drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight.\" The songcraft of both acts is impeccable, but they leave the Grammys with a headache. Neither act could be considered the defining sound of 2021. In fact, Batiste's album failed to chart in the UK and only reached number 86 in the US. Worse than that, their victories meant that younger, forward-thinking acts like Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish were overlooked - with neither collecting a trophy, despite multiple nominations. Thank goodness, then, for Olivia Rodrigo - who was recognised for a stellar debut year that saw her score a global hit with the break-up ballad Drivers License, then top it with the whiplash-inducing pop-punk of Good 4 U. As well as best new artist, she also picked up best pop solo performance and best pop album. The 19-year-old dedicated the latter to her parents, saying the award was \"for you guys and because of you guys\". \"When I was nine years old, I told my mom I was going to be an Olympic gymnast, even though I could barely do a cartwheel,\" she recalled. \"The next week, when I told her I was gonna win a Grammy, she was very supportive, even though I'm sure she thought it was just a little kid pipe dream. \"I want to thank my mom for being supportive of all of my dreams, no matter how crazy; and I want to thank my mom and my dad for being equally as proud of me for winning a Grammy as they were when I learned how to do a back walkover.\" There were also three awards for Foo Fighters, a little more than a week after drummer Taylor Hawkins was found dead in his Colombia hotel room at the age of 50. Presenter Jimmy Jam accepted the prizes in the band's absence, \"with prayers to their loved ones\". The ceremony was held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, after a three month delay due to the Covid-19 surge in the US. \"Don't even think of it as an award show,\" said host Trevor Noah. \"Think of it as a concert where we're giving out awards\". He kept his word. For the first 25 minutes, the show shunned prizes to concentrate on music, with three back-to-back performances from the night's main nominees. Silk Sonic opened the show with a funky strut through their Vegas-themed track 777; followed by Olivia Rodrigo, who gave a sensitive reading of her ballad Drivers License from inside the vintage white Mercedes she drove in the song's video. Third came reggaeton star J Balvin, who pivoted from the sensual duet QuÃ© MÃ¡s Pues to a raucous, intricately-choreographed performance of In De Getto. If the Grammys wanted to display the breadth of this year's nominees in three songs, they succeeded. And then they kept going. BTS tore the roof off the MGM Grand with a heist-themed performance of their pop smash Butter; while Billie Eilish's scorching rendition of Happier Than Ever could only be extinguished by an on-stage rainstorm. Chris Stapleton, who dominated the country music categories, gave a gruff but mesmerising performance of best country song winner Cold; and Lady Gaga threw herself into the jazz standards Love For Sale and Do I Love You, as she paid tribute to her duet partner Tony Bennett, who was unable to attend the ceremony for health reasons. At the end of the performance, Gaga was moved to tears. \"I love you, Tony,\" she said into the mic. \"We miss you.\" By focusing on music over sketches and set pieces, the Grammys became pacier and less self-indulgent than years gone by. It was the right lesson to learn from last year's scaled-back ceremony, where Covid restrictions forced artists into more intimate stagings. The ceremony also continued last year's innovation of celebrating behind-the-scenes talent, whose livelihoods were interrupted by the pandemic. After highlighting independent music venues in 2021, this year's ceremony turned the spotlight on women working behind the scenes. Among them was Billie Eilish's tour manager Nicole Massey, who called the star as \"the best 20-year-old boss in the world\". The ceremony took place a week after the Oscars - and the altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock wasn't far from people's minds. During a non-televised portion of the ceremony, one presenter, Nate Bargatze, introduced the classical nominees while sporting a helmet. \"This is what comedians at awards shows have to wear now,\" he joked. Noah also referenced the incident during his opening speech. \"We're going to be dancing, we're going to be singing, we're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,\" he said. In contrast to Rock's barbs, however, the South African's monologue was positively good-natured, full of gentle quips about Lil Nas X's height (he's taller than you'd expect) and the show's Las Vegas setting. \"Look at this, people are doing shots,\" he gestured to the audience at home. \"I mean, last year, people were doing shots, but it was more Moderna and Pfizer. This time, we're back in the mix.\" In what must have been a relief for the organisers, habitual award show disruptor Kanye West decided not to attend, after having his invitation to perform withdrawn for \"concerning online behaviour\". However, the star (who now goes by the name Ye) picked up two awards in the rap categories: best rap song for Jail and best melodic rap performance for Hurricane. Bennett, meanwhile, became the second-oldest Grammy winner in history. The star, who is 95, won best traditional pop vocal album for the 14th time for Love for Sale, his collaborative album of Cole Porter songs with Lady Gaga. The oldest Grammy winner remains 97-year-old Mississippi blues artist Pinetop Perkins, who won best traditional blues album in 2011 for his record Joined At The Hip.

            " Star of BBC soap EastEnders dies aged 95 \n",
            " Actress June Brown, who played the much-loved character Dot Cotton on EastEnders for more than three decades, has died at the age of 95. Her family said they were \"deeply saddened\" to announce that their \"beloved mother\" had died \"very peacefully\" at her home on Sunday. EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt described her as an \"incredible woman\". Dot Cotton was one of the BBC soap's longest-running characters and a favourite with viewers. Brown first appeared in the series in 1985, the year EastEnders was created. She stayed until 1993, returning to play the same character from 1997 until 2020. An EastEnders spokesperson said: \"There are not enough words to describe how much June was loved and adored by everyone at EastEnders, her loving warmth, wit and great humour will never be forgotten. \"June created one of the most iconic characters in Dot Cotton, not just in soap but in British television, and having appeared in 2884 episodes, June's remarkable performances created some of EastEnders finest moments.\" After Brown's death was announced, many fans began sharing their favourite TV moment of hers - when the actress met Lady Gaga on the BBC's Graham Norton show. One of EastEnders' best-known stars, Brown was in her late 50s when she joined Albert Square. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Dirty Den, suggested her for the role. Until then, Brown's career had incorporated stage, film and television, with appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. Some of her biggest storylines included Nasty Nick's murder plot, when her son, played by John Altman, planned to poison her so he could steal her big bingo winnings to use on drugs. He changed his mind at the last minute. One of her most moving and controversial moments came when her close friend Ethel, who was terminally ill, asked Dot to help her take an overdose of morphine to end her life. Dot wrestled with her Christian beliefs but ultimately decided to leave out morphine pills for Ethel to take. Her relationship with husband Jim Branning, played by the late John Bardon, was much cherished by fans of the soap. Brown remained a favourite with viewers for years, but during a podcast interview in February 2020, she confirmed that she had left the series \"for good\". In the last episode she featured in, Dot Cotton - or Dot Branning - left a voicemail message for another character, Sonia Fowler, saying she had moved to Ireland. Following the news of Brown's death, Woodyatt - who played Ian Beale in the soap for 35 years - said in a statement: \"I'm lost for words, something June never was. \"So many memories, so much fun. Just purely and simply an incredible woman who had the most incredible life and career, I was fortunate to have shared a small part of it. They never made you a Dame (we did try), but to me you will always be Dame Brown.\" Gillian Taylforth, who plays Kathy Beale in the BBC soap, said: \"I'm truly heartbroken by this news. June Brown OBE, MBE, was an amazing woman and a truly wonderful actress. I shared many scenes with her over the years and she was always someone I looked up to and learnt from. There will never be another June Brown and I'm sending all my love to her family.\" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Brown was a \"true national treasure\". \"There was nobody quite like June Brown. She captured the zeitgeist of British culture like no other in her many years on our screens,\" she said. \"Today we've lost a true national treasure but my goodness what a life she has led. Rest in peace.\" EastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw said Brown was an \"iconic\" character both on and off screen. The BBC's director-general Tim Davie said: \"June Brown was a brilliantly talented actor who was loved by millions.  Her performances as the incomparable Dot Cotton delivered some of the most memorable moments in soap history.\" \"Our thoughts are with her family and many friends.\" After she left the soap, Brown starred in a Christmas drama podcast in December 2020 as part of a series about family separation during the pandemic. She played the mother of a son with Down's syndrome in the play, which explored the strains of the mother-son relationship during enforced isolation. Other tributes were paid by former EastEnders star and activist Michael Cashman, who played the UK's first gay character in a soap opera, Colin Russell. He wrote: \"She took this country on an amazing journey and changed it for the better.\" Cashman has previously spoken about how Brown helped him get time off rehearsals so he could go to an anti-Section 28 protest in London in 1988. Actor and writer Stephen Fry also said Brown will be remembered \"as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally\". He tweeted: \"June Brown, amongst all her other wonderful human qualities and achievements, will be remembered as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally - especially during the darkest days of HIV/AIDS and Section 28... it was a privilege to know her.\" Comedian Mo Gilligan also posted on Twitter: \"If you grew up on an estate there was always a Dot Cotton. Absolute iconic character in EastEnders.\" \n",

            " PM 'will not rest until justice done' over Ukraine \n",
            " Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said \"we will not rest until justice is done\", amid further evidence of continued atrocities in Ukraine. Distressing images of civilian bodies in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to international outrage over Russia's actions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations' Human Rights Council. She has also pushed for tougher international sanctions on Russia. In a news conference in the Polish capital Warsaw, Ms Truss said: \"What we have seen in the streets of Irpin and Bucha are scenes that we will never forget. We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians.\" She added: \"We are clear, that after these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council\". A senior Westminster source has told the BBC the government is considering further action against Russian soldiers as individuals. Officials are looking at further sanctions that could target captains, majors and colonels in the Russian military. It is understood this additional pressure could also include looking at ways to hold Russian soldiers legally accountable. Mr Johnson has said the UK \"will not stand by whilst this indiscriminate and unforgivable slaughter takes place\". He added: \"We are working to ensure those responsible are held to account. We will not rest until justice is done.\" Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in the areas around Kyiv so far. Russia, without evidence, has said the photos and videos were \"a staged performance\" by Ukraine. Ms Truss reiterated the prime minister's comments, saying that the UK \"will not rest until these criminals are brought to justice\". She said \"it's very clear war crimes have taken place\" and the UK is taking \"the maximum approach on sanctions, nothing is off the table\". Ms Truss added that Nato needs to use a meeting this week to \"step up support\" and sanctions. She said these measures should include more countries banning Russian ships from ports, sanctions on more banks and other sectors. In addition to this, she said countries should set out a \"clear timetable\" for eliminating Russia energy use. Ms Truss met with Ukraine's Foreign Secretary Dmytro Kuleba in Poland ahead of key G7 and Nato talks. Also speaking at the news conference in Warsaw, Mr Kuleba said: \"What you have seen, the horrors that we have seen in Bucha, are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine so far.\" The foreign secretary will also hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, on Tuesday. She has pledged a Â£10m civil society fund for Ukraine, including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence, following reports of Russian forces sexually assaulting people in Ukraine, as a way of terrorising the population. Ms Truss has said Russia's President Vladimir Putin \"is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy\". She said \"a tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations\". She added the UK would do more \"to ramp up the pressure\" on Russia and \"keep pushing others to do more\". The BBC's Reality Check team and BBC Monitoring have been investigating Russia's claims about the killings carried out in Bucha. Ukraine has accused Russia of \"deliberate massacre\", but Russia has crticised \"a staged provocation\" by Ukraine. The Kremlin claims the evidence, seen by the BBC and several news outlets, is inaccurate on three grounds: On Sunday, Mr Johnson said Russia's \"despicable attacks\" on innocent Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and Irpin were \"yet more evidence\" of war crimes. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly called Mr Putin a war criminal and has recently said he should face a trial over the killings in Bucha. Mr Biden said he was also seeking more sanctions against Russia over the atrocities. Mr Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the weekend. Following their conversation on Saturday evening, Mr Zelensky said there would be a \"new package\" of \"very, very tangible support\". \n",

            " Federal Reserve warns of \"brewing U.S. housing bubble\" \n",
            " Homebuyers have faced a dilemma during the pandemic: Swallow rapid price increases and forgo typical steps like house inspections, or risk getting left out of the real estate market. Those dynamics have caused some observers to question whether the U.S. is repeating the housing bubble of the early 2000s, which led to a painful housing crash in 2006 and the Great Recession the following year. The answer, warns the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is that the property market is showing \"signs of a brewing U.S. housing bubble.\" That may be unsettling to millions of potential homebuyers who are coping with myriad financial pressure points. For one, mortgage rates are swiftly rising, reaching an average of 4.67% for a fixed 30-year loan for the week ended March 31 — the highest since 2018, according to Freddie Mac. And the national median listing price for a home has jumped to a record $405,000, Realtor.com said on March 31. Home buying jumped during the pandemic due to a confluence of trends. For starters, millennials now represent the largest U.S. generation and have moved into their prime home buying years. And the pandemic forced millions of people to work from home, prompting some to move out of cities or look for bigger dwellings to cope with the reality of remote work. The typical listing price for a home has jumped almost 27% in the past two years, Realtor.com said. To be sure, a rapid rise in home values doesn't necessarily signal a bubble, the economists at the Dallas Fed noted. \"But real house prices can diverge from market fundamentals when there is widespread belief that today's robust price increases will continue,\" they noted. \"If many buyers share this belief, purchases arising from a 'fear of missing out' can drive up prices and heighten expectations of strong house-price gains.\" Meanwhile, more home buyers are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, since these loans offer a lower initial rate for a number of years but then adjust annually at higher rates. Demand for ARMs has jumped 26% from a year earlier, according to real estate company Inman. The current rate for a 5/1 ARM (with the initial rate set for five years) is 3.5%. There are signs that rising rates are impacting the real estate market, with Redfin predicting that home-price growth will slow. More sellers are reducing their asking prices after listing, the real-estate company said on March 31. To examine whether the current dynamics could reflect a bubble, the Dallas Fed economists dug into three different market metrics. Their conclusion: There are signs of a \"market tipping point.\" First, the economists looked at a statistical model that tracks \"exuberance,\" or when prices increase at an exponential rate that can't be justified by economic fundamentals. When their exuberance measure reaches a 95% threshold, that signals 95% confidence that the market is experiencing \"abnormal explosive behavior,\" they noted. The current exuberance measure: 115%. Next, the economists looked at another measure of valuation: Comparing home prices against the sum of discounted future rents. It's a similar concept to how investors determine the value of a stock by looking at discounted future dividends, the economists noted. That, too, is showing exuberance that is \"comparable to the run-up of the last housing boom,\" they said. Third, the analysts examined the ratio of home prices to disposable income, another measure of housing affordability. This hasn't risen to the level of exuberance, but the economists noted that household disposable income was buoyed during the pandemic by stimulus checks as well as a decrease in household spending due to lockdowns — transitory factors, in other words. Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, said that while the current rate of home price growth was unsustainable, it's hard to predict when the price increases will slow. \"Double-digit price increases and rent increases can't go on   forever,\"  she said. Hale said that rising mortgage rates, which  make housing less affordable, should slow the pace of price increases somewhat. \"When   mortgage rates were falling, that helped cushion high housing costs,   because people had smaller monthly payments. Now rates are moving in the   opposite direction and it's increasing the monthly costs. That means   prices will not be able to sustain the double-digit pace of growth,\" she  said. There are a few differences between 2022 and the 2006 real estate peak that collapsed into a global financial crisis that took years to heal, the economists pointed out. For one, household finances are in better shape than they were in 2006, and the type of easy-to-secure loan that fueled that housing boom is a thing of the past. Back then, some banks doled out so-called \"liar's loans,\" or mortgages that required little or no documentation of income. Today, banks require buyers to verify their income to qualify for a loan. But there's something else going on that the economists have flagged as worrisome: \"A fear-of-missing-out wave of exuberance involving new investors and more aggressive speculation among existing investors.\" A fallout from a housing correction from the current real estate boom wouldn't be similar to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they said. But for some recent home owners, a correction could still prove painful. CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed reporting. \n",

            " Suspect arrested in Sacramento shooting that left 6 dead, 12 wounded \n",
            " SACRAMENTO — Less than two blocks from California’s pristine state Capitol park, flowers, candles and stuffed animals dot the downtown sidewalks where six people were killed early Sunday in a mass shooting that injured 12 others. Shattered glass remained inside a shuttered jewelry store while friends and family gathered to remember their loved ones hours after authorities announced an arrest in the deadly  shooting. “This is not OK,” Patricia Powell said through heavy sobs. Her brother, DeVazia Turner, 29, was out Saturday night out with friends and his cousin, Sergio Harris, at the nearby London nightclub before he was killed. Harris, 38, was also killed. “I’m not going to see him no more,” Powell cried. Turner’s father, Frank Turner, shook his head as the family attempted to console Powell. He said his son was a devoted father of four with a “bubbly” personality that lit up any room he walked into. “His whole life revolved around his kids,” Turner said Monday afternoon, standing near the site where his son was gunned down. “He was really a family man. That was his passion — his kids.” Turner’s children, aged 10 to 3, are staying with Frank Turner, who said they are too young to fully grasp the tragedy. They’re crying for their daddy. They’re screaming for their daddy,” Frank Turner said. “He was a very bubbly person,” Turner said. “He brought a smile to your face. You just liked to be around him.” Earlier Monday, Dandrae Martin, 26, was booked on assault and illegal firearm possession charges, Sacramento police said. As part of their investigation, authorities served search warrants at three residences, which turned up at least one handgun, police said. The surviving victims have wounds from minor to critical. The shooting occurred in a bustling downtown area shortly after last call. Investigators believe multiple shooters opened fire in the wake of a large fight. During the preliminary processing of the scene, police said, investigators identified at least three buildings and three vehicles that had been struck by gunfire. Investigators recovered more than 100 shell casings. More than 100 video or photo files have been provided to investigators through the community evidence portal. The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office will review all evidence to determine appropriate charges, police said. Martin was booked into jail in Sacramento County on two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and a felony count of being a convicted person carrying a loaded firearm, according to online records from the sheriff's office. It was not immediately clear Monday afternoon whether Martin had retained an attorney. Martin also has an outstanding warrant from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. He is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday afternoon, jail records said. Martin pleaded guilty in October 2014 to a misdemeanor charge related to a domestic violence case, said a spokesperson with the Riverside County District Attorney's Office. Martin was sentenced to 30 days’ custody and 36 months of probation. He violated two terms of probation, and a $5,000 bench warrant was issued in October 2015, the spokesperson said. The Sacramento County Coroner’s office identified the four other victims as Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; Johntaya Alexander, 21; Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21; and Melinda Davis, 57, a homeless resident of a nearby park. Kay Harris, 32, Harris’ sister, told The Associated Press that she had been asleep when a family member called her to say they feared her brother had been killed. Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester said officers near the scene heard the gunfire around 2 a.m. They rushed to the site, administered CPR and secured the scene, she said. At least one city security video camera captured some of the violence, Lester said. “The scale of violence that just happened in our city is unprecedented in my 27 years at the Sacramento Police Department,” Lester said. President Joe Biden called on Congress for further action to address gun violence. “Today, America once again mourns for another community devastated by gun violence,” he said in a statement Sunday. “But we must do more than mourn; we must act.” Mayor Darrell Steinberg called the shooting “a senseless and unacceptable tragedy.” “Can we not have a sane debate where, on one side of the line, you say that people who want to use firearms for sport or for hunting or, you know, with reasonable self-defense on one side of the line, and on the other side of the line we say there is absolutely no place for rapid-fire assault weapons anywhere, anyhow?” Steinberg asked. “I mean, can we have that? Can we make that distinction?” \n",

            " The ‘ranch’ for pregnant women with nowhere to go \n",
            " Texas has passed one the strictest abortion laws in the US, banning the procedure after around six weeks' gestation. That has left many women looking for options. It was shortly after the birth of her second child, when Dallas-based Aubrey Schlackman had an epiphany. \"We'd been to the grocery store and were driving home. And I passed a big ranch for sale, and I just suddenly had the idea,\" she says. She wanted to open a place that could provide accommodation and support for single mothers facing an unforeseen pregnancy. \"I feel like wide-open spaces give a natural space for healing and contemplation. And I think God uses nature as a way to heal,\" she says. Aubrey and her husband Bryan had been working with Christian ministry programmes taking care of pregnant women. \"A lot of them were first-time moms,\" Bryan says. \"And then we discovered there were lots of situations where a mother with existing children who got unexpectedly pregnant did not have many places to go.\" So the Schlackmans founded a non-profit, Blue Haven Ranch. Although it does not yet exist as the ranch Aubrey envisages, the charity is currently supporting five single mothers who are either pregnant or who have recently given birth, providing cash to rent an apartment, and help towards utility bills. Eventually, the couple hope to purchase 100 acres of Texas farmland to build Blue Haven Ranch from scratch: cottages for 20 single mothers and their children, a community hub where families can cook and eat together, fields for animals and land for vegetable cultivation. The Schlackmans estimate it will cost around $15 million (Â£11m), and their fundraising efforts are going well, buoyed perhaps by the passing of the Heartbeat Act, also known as SB8 - Senate Bill 8 - last September. That law prohibits abortions from as early as six weeks into pregnancy, after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat - a flutter from a group of cells that will regulate the rhythm of a heart when it later forms. This can happen even before a woman knows she's pregnant. One of the most restrictive laws in the country, SB8 gives any citizen the right to sue another individual suspected of \"aiding and abetting\" an abortion. Those individuals could be a doctor, or even an Uber driver taking a woman to an abortion clinic. \"A lot of women are really scared,\" says Qiana Arnold of the Afiya Centre, a reproductive rights NGO in Dallas supporting Black women, about the impact of SB8. \"[Pro-life] protesters are getting more aggressive. And the way the language of the law has been communicated in the media, it's like abortion is illegal in Texas. It isn't - but you've got to move fast,\" she says. SB8 is the latest piece of legislation in the state to further restrict access to termination. Together, changes in the law have led to the shuttering of many abortion services, leaving thousands of women asking: What can they do now? Some are turning to services provided by non-profits like Blue Haven Ranch. The charity is part of a network of Christian, faith-based organisations aimed at discouraging women from seeking abortion by offering alternative services to support them through pregnancy and early motherhood. \"Whatever your religion, if you want to be pro-life, you have to be pro-mom. And you have to do something. I think belief is a call to action - always,\" says Aubrey. At Blue Haven Ranch, mothers are expected to work when they are not on maternity leave, and to take educational courses that will help them secure better-paid employment so they can provide for their children once they leave. Britney* found the project at a critical juncture in her life. She was pregnant, a mother of three who fled an abusive relationship. She was conflicted about having her fourth child, and worried her other children might be taken into care. \"I felt like physically and mentally, I could not provide for all of them safely,\" she says. Britney's sister drove her to one of the few abortion clinics still operating in Texas. \"Very quickly, they were like, 'we can't help you',\" Britney says - she was more than six weeks pregnant. Leaving the clinic crying, she was handed a leaflet by an anti-abortion protester. She called the number on the leaflet and was put in touch with Aubrey. \"It sounded pretty helpful, and talked about not feeling alone. I felt like this was my last option,\" she recalls. Now Britney works two jobs from home, her three children live with her in an apartment funded by Blue Haven Ranch, and she is getting ready to give birth. \"The plan is to keep working, save and get my own home one day. I'm just blessed that I found Aubrey,\" she says. The Schlackmans say that women who join Blue Haven Ranch do not have to be Christian. But they are obliged to attend bible-study sessions. Aubrey does not see this as coercive, and it was not an issue for Britney, either. But the set-up does leave open the question - is it ethical for pregnant women in crisis to be on the receiving end of religious evangelising? Critics point to the dozens of \"crisis pregnancy centres\" that have opened across Texas. Unlike the service the Schlackmans offer, they do not provide accommodation. They provide free pregnancy tests and scans, essentials for newborns, and sometimes support for women to further their education. Usually faith-based, they do not readily advertise their anti-abortion stance. And, they have been accused of giving pregnant women misleading information to discourage abortion. \"A lot of people think those are places they can get access to abortion,\" says Ms Arnold. \"They tell women they can get an ultrasound. Then boom - someone else comes in and they start talking about religion. They say, 'Please don't kill your babyâ¦ We'll give you some pampers'. And it's really traumatic for women because that's not what they went there for,\" she says. But as they proliferate, such programmes will only become increasingly wrapped up in the abortion debate in Texas. The state is supporting faith-based initiatives through its 'Alternatives to Abortion' programme, funded with a budget of $100 million. This channels money to some of the 'crisis pregnancy centres', and other non-profits. Even outside the ideological debate, Ms Arnold says funding from state-backed programmes rarely trickles down to the communities she serves - the poor women of colour who have been most severely affected by the reduced access to abortion. \"To have an unwanted child - you're trying to force people to bring a life that they don't want to,\" she argues. Britney was never completely sure she wanted to terminate her latest pregnancy, and found refuge in Blue Haven Ranch. But many women do know when abortion is right for them - and because of SB8, this has become much harder. A University of Texas study reported around 1,400 Texans a month were travelling out-of-state for a termination after the implementation of SB8. Mariah is also a mother of three, and lives in west Texas. She is a single parent, and works two jobs providing for her children. In October, Mariah's carefully calibrated, busy life threatened to be capsized when she discovered she was pregnant. \"I couldn't stop shaking and crying,\" she says. \"I knew this new law had just passed, and I'm like - how far along am I? Am I going to be able to get an abortion? Where do I start? I have to do this. I have to do it tomorrowâ¦\" Mariah borrowed cash from friends, and drove for over three hours to the nearest clinic in Austin. While she had an ultrasound, Mariah held her breath. Then she breathed a sigh of relief - not yet six weeks pregnant, she was able to access the drugs for a medical abortion. She does not regret it. \"Because I have three kids. I don't mean to sound heartless, but I don't have any emotions towards it. And I do think women should have that right [to abortion].\" Meanwhile, Aubrey and Bryan continue their plans to expand their offer at Blue Haven Ranch. The couple are leaving their comfortable Argyle bungalow with its chicken coop and vegetable patch for a home with more land further north in Dallas. This new property will be a small prototype of their project, so wealthy donors will see they are serious, they say. Already, Blue Haven Ranch is getting noticed. \"We got a surprise donation of $14,000 one Tuesday - it just showed up in the bank account of the non-profit. And so I knew something was coming because God doesn't drop that kind of money for it to just sit there,\" Aubrey says. The following Friday, she got a call from a pregnant mother fleeing an abusive marriage, and was able to offer her support and an apartment. Currently there are six women on Blue Haven's waiting list, but the Schlackmans will not take on a new pregnant mother and her children unless they have money in the bank to provide for them for at least six months. And since SB8 became law, there has been an uptick in interest in Blue Haven Ranch. \"We have increased applications. We probably get an average of one to three applications every couple of weeks,\" says Aubrey. As Bryan puts it: \"The Heartbeat Act got us on the map.\" \n",

            " Angry Sri Lankans want president to go \n",
            " Sri Lanka's cabinet and central bank governor have all quit as anger grows over rising food and fuel prices. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has invited all parties to be a part of a new government. But as the economic crisis worsens in the country, those who've taken to the streets in protest say they won't stop until Mr Rajapaksa resigns. Across an island bubbling with anger and desperation, the chants and the placards are mostly directed at one man. \"Go Gota Go,\" \"Go Gota Go,\" they say. Gota is short for Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the country's controversial president who many blame for the dire situation people are facing. \"He needs to go, he's robbed everything from us,\" said Nadhie Wandurgala who defied a country-wide curfew to protest on Sunday with her husband and two daughters. As she clutched a handmade poster she explained how her family had gone from living comfortable lives to daily discomfort - power cuts of up to 17 hours, a daily scramble to find gas to cook with, and long queues to get petrol for their car. \"Even hospitals are running out of medicine, schools are running out of paper for exams, but the politicians get electricity every day.\" \"They've never stood in long queues to get gas or kerosene,\" she said, her voice full of contempt for those in power. Nadhie isn't an activist or a seasoned protestor. She works for the city's clergy and prefers to stay away from politics. But she's typical of the groundswell of anti-government opinion which is uniting people from all backgrounds, faiths and ages. As Sri Lanka runs low on foreign currency reserves, it has been unable to pay for imports of essentials such as fuel. A drop in tourism due to the pandemic is one factor, but many say the president has mismanaged this crisis. Experts say policies introduced by Mr Rajapaksa after he was elected in 2019 -  steep tax cuts and an import ban - have exacerbated the crisis, as has his reluctance to get help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mr Rajapaksa has blamed previous administrations for the current state of affairs, but many like Nadhie's daughter Anjalee say it's time for him to resign immediately and accept full responsibility. And as frustration grows, so have fears that his government is trying to stifle any criticism directed towards it. Sunday's curfew is just one measure designed to stop people from gathering. There was also a social media blackout and a special presidential notification prohibiting people from \" being on any public road, in a park, on trains or on the seashore\" unless they have written permission from the authorities. Nadhie and Anjalee were just some of the hundreds who risked arrest to attend a demonstration, taking to the streets despite the order to stay home. \"I came out today because my rights have been taken away. We have nothing to lose at this point.\" \"Why have they even introduced this curfew ? Is it to protect us?\" Anjalee mused. \"It doesn't make sense at all\". \"I would call these dictatorial, autocratic and draconian steps,\" opposition leader Sajith Premadasa told me at an impromptu protest on Sunday. Mr Premadasa and other members of his party were stopped at police barricades as they tried to enter the city's Independence square. \"The supreme law of the land protects the right of the people to share their opinions, to demonstrate and to engage in peaceful democratic activities, so that right cannot be violated.\" This isn't the first time President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who runs the country alongside his elder brother Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has been accused of stifling freedom of expression. The brothers have a history which goes well beyond their election victory in 2019. Mahinda Rajapaksa has been president twice, while Gotabaya Rajapaksa is well known for his position as defence secretary when he was accused of perpetrating serious human rights violations in the final stages of Sri Lanka's civil war. Both also have a reputation of brutally cracking down on dissent. In 2019, months after Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday bombings Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the majority of popular support, after promising to rule Sri Lanka with a \"strong hand\". \"People thought they'd provide us with national security, but they didn't.. they failed at everything,\" said Roshinta, who says she did not vote for him. \"I don't want to see my country go to waste because of this particular family. They are so adamant and greedy for power they'll probably stay on.\" On Thursday, the anger directed at President Rajapaksa went right to his doorstep, as protests outside his residence in Colombo turned violent. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, and authorities arrested dozens of protesters as well as some journalists covering the incident. In a tweet, the EU delegation in Colombo urged the Sri Lankan authorities to \"safeguard democratic rights of all citizens, including the right to free assembly and dissent, which has to be peaceful.\" Human rights groups including Amnesty International said many of those detained had been assaulted in custody. Soon after Thursday's protests, a state of emergency was imposed on the island, giving security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention - authorities said it was to ensure law and order was maintained. Overnight from Saturday into Sunday, officials in Sri Lanka's Western Province said they'd arrested more than 600 people for violating the curfew. On Sunday afternoon as we visited protests in Colombo, police with riot shields stood at a distance from demonstrators, watching on. \"This is the first time in my life I've protested,\" said Sathsara as he stood by the side of a park wearing a t-shirt for one of his favourite bands, Oasis. \"This is my last resort\" The 29-year-old advertising copywriter who lives in the capital Colombo,  usually spends his weekends going to gigs and eating out with friends, but all that's stopped. \"We are at the prime of our lives, how are we going to achieve our dreams with all this happening?\" With daily power cuts and the cost of food spiralling, Sathsara says his bank balance is depleting, while his desperation mounts. \"Give us a government who can manage this. This one literally doesn't care about us,\" he said. At another protest of mostly young families, Suchitra, cradling his 15-month-old baby boy, told me he was exhausted by the power cuts which don't allow his son to sleep. \"The politicians in parliament are unfit. They've put the country in turmoil,\" he said. \"They've not kept to their promises, people can't suffer anymore.\" \n",

            " Senate leaders reach agreement on $10 billion for Covid relief efforts \n",
            " WASHINGTON — Key Senate leaders struck an agreement Monday on bipartisan legislation to provide $10 billion in Covid response funding that no longer includes money for overseas efforts to fight the virus. In the agreement, announced by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, $5 billion would be designated for therapeutics, with the rest going toward vaccines, including booster shots, and testing capacity. The deal covers most of the White House's request with one major exception: funds for global efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. It comes after previous efforts by Congress failed amid disagreements over how to structure and finance the legislation. \"Importantly, this bill is comprised of dollar-for-dollar offsets and will not cost the American people a single additional dollar,\" Romney said in a statement. \"While this agreement does not include funding for the U.S. global vaccination program, I am willing to explore a fiscally-responsible solution to support global efforts in the weeks ahead.\" The legislation would be financed by repurposing unspent Covid money from previous aid packages, including the $2 trillion CARES Act of 2020 and $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan of 2021. Senate leaders hope to pass the legislation this week before a planned two-week recess. They'll have to juggle that goal with a likely Supreme Court confirmation vote of Ketanji Brown Jackson, which is also expected this week. The Covid aid bill would still need to be passed by the House before being sent to President Joe Biden's desk. \"This $10 billion COVID package will give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe,\" Schumer said. \"But while this emergency injection of additional funding is absolutely necessary, it is well short of what is truly needed to keep us safe from the COVID-19 virus over the long-term.\" He said he was \"disappointed that our Republican colleagues could not agree to include the $5 billion in global health funding\" and will work to authorize that in \"separate legislation.\" The White House initially requested $22.5 billion for Covid aid as part of a $1.5 trillion government spending bill that was passed last month. The coronavirus funding was stripped out to ensure the overall legislation, which included emergency aid to Ukraine, got enough Republican votes to get across the finish line. \n",

            " Senate panel deadlocks on Biden Supreme Court pick \n",
            " A US Senate panel has deadlocked in a vote to approve President Joe Biden's nominee for the Supreme Court, but she is likely to be confirmed anyway later this week. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would become the first black woman on the nation's highest judicial body. The nine-member court is currently split between six Republican-appointed justices and three picked by Democrats. Judge Jackson would replace Stephen Breyer, another liberal justice. The Senate judiciary committee, which like the full chamber is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, voted 11-11 on Monday on whether to back her nomination. A final vote before the 100-member Senate is expected by Friday. On Monday evening two Republican senators, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, declared support for Judge Jackson. With one other Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, having already said she will vote for the nominee, Judge Jackson's confirmation is assured. Democrats point out Judge Jackson would become the first former public defender on the court, and cite her experience in nine years on the federal bench. But many Republicans found fault with her decision during 30 hours of confirmation hearings not to comment on whether seats should be added to the Supreme Court, and her remark that she could not define the term \"woman\". They also accused her of leniency in child pornography cases. If confirmed, Judge Jackson, 51, would be the first black woman justice named to the Supreme Court in its 233-year history. She would also be just the third black American to ever sit on the country's top court, following justices Thurgood Marshall and current Justice Clarence Thomas. The jurist, a Washington DC native, currently sits on the influential US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. For any Supreme Court justice nomination, the president chooses his preferred candidate who then faces a vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee before final approval by the Senate. The court plays a crucial role in US life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. For the first time since 1991, the judiciary committee has deadlocked on whether to recommend confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. Back then, it was Clarence Thomas - mired in allegations of sexual harassment - who failed to win majority support. This time, the dispute is purely ideological. Even Ketanji Brown Jackson's critics laud her character and the ground-breaking nature of her nomination. Their objection is with her judicial philosophy - and the way she would presumably vote on high-profile issues like abortion, religious freedom and civil rights. While Jackson appears likely to prevail, the manner of her confirmation does not bode well for a process that is becoming increasingly entrenched in partisanship. Only a handful of senators have crossed party lines in recent Supreme Court confirmations - something that was once common. The one occasion since 1991 that a Supreme Court vacancy has come up when the Senate and the presidency were controlled by different parties, the nominee - Merrick Garland, selected by President Obama in 2016 - was not even allowed a committee hearing. If Republicans win control of the Senate this year, it appears likely the door will slam shut on any future Biden Supreme Court nominees. \n",

            " Elon Musk buys 9 percent stake in Twitter \n",
            " One of Twitter's loudest critics and most prominent users is now one of its biggest shareholders. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bought up about 9.2 percent of Twitter, according to a regulatory filing Monday that detailed his stock purchases. The stock-buying revelation comes as Musk emerges as one of the loudest and most prominent critics of Twitter's moderation efforts, which in recent years have cracked down on everything from harassment and death threats to misinformation and conspiracy theories. News of Musk’s move sparked some hope among conservatives who have been critical of Twitter's enforcement of its rules and its ban on former President Donald Trump. Musk, who the Bloomberg Billionaire Index lists as the world's richest person with a net worth of about $273 billion, has in recent months said on Twitter — where he comments regularly — that he had given \"serious thought\" to building a competitor to the company. He said in a post last month that given that the social media platform \"serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.\" Musk’s stake in Twitter is considered a passive investment, which means he is a long-term investor who's looking to minimize his buying and selling of shares. But the sizable stake, along with Musk's recent comments, indicate that he could be looking to exert some control of the company. “We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,” Dan Ives of WedBush Securities wrote in a client note early Monday. Musk's first tweet since the news broke Monday offered a bit of levity to the situation: Twitter’s stock surged more than 25 percent before the market opened Monday, while shares of Tesla rose slightly. Musk has clashed with regulators about his use of Twitter. Last month, Musk asked a federal judge to nullify a subpoena from securities regulators and throw out a 2018 court agreement in which he had to have someone pre-approve his posts on Twitter. At the time, U.S. securities regulators said they had legal authority to subpoena Tesla and Musk about his tweets, and that Musk’s move to throw out a 2018 court agreement that his tweets be pre-approved is not valid. Musk's criticism of Twitter — happening almost exclusively on Twitter — has been mounting. In late march, he tweeted a poll asking people if they thought Twitter \"rigorously adheres\" to free speech principles. About 70 percent of the more than 2 million votes tallied said \"No.\" \"The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,\" Musk added. If Musk does decide to try to exert influence on Twitter, it would be the second activist shareholder push on the company in just a few years. Elliott Management, an investment firm known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management changes, took a sizable stake in Twitter in early 2020 and pushed for then-CEO Jack Dorsey to step down. Dorsey was able to strike a deal with Elliott Management that allowed him to say for the time being. Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November, though he remains on the company's board of directors. \n",

            " U.N. report outlines possible solutions for climate change and its societal impact \n",
            " From wildfires to sea level rise and heat waves, climate change is having a dramatic impact on the environment and people’s health and well-being. So what can the world do about it? That’s the focus of the third and final report — released Monday — from a recent cycle of climate discussions among scientists with the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. More than 230 authors contributed to the report, which summarizes researchers’ best thinking on how to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. Previous reports detailed the physical changes the world is experiencing because of climate change and how they are already affecting society. In a news conference about the report’s findings, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres chided global leaders in a searing critique, saying the new report highlighted “a litany of broken climate promises” and a catalog of “shame” showing the world is on the wrong track. “Government and business leaders are saying one thing and doing another. Simply put, they are lying,” he said. Still, the latest report strikes a somewhat hopeful tone about energy transition and suggests achievable solutions are in hand. Renewable energy costs are plummeting and investment in electric vehicles has provided a vision of the path forward, the scientists suggest. “We are at a crossroads. This is the time for action. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming and secure a liveable future” IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said during the news conference announcing the report. But the stakes have never been greater. “Unless there are immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees [Celsius] will be beyond reach,” said Jim Skea, a professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London and one of the report’s co-chairs. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” Here are five key takeaways from the report’s summary. Transportation represented about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 and in the past, it wasn’t clear how to rapidly decarbonize vehicles. But, the world has come a long way since 2014 when scientists last assessed  progress on reducing emissions with the IPCC. Electric vehicle advertisements dominated Super Bowl advertising in the United States and a global race to mine metals for clean energy is underway. “The technology that’s available has really transformed the idea that the transport sector … can’t get its emissions down to zero,” said Jae Edmonds, the chief scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Joint Global Change Research Institute, and an author of the IPCC report. “You can see a pathway that could take you there.” Renewable energy, more broadly, has become cheaper, the report says. Since 2010, the cost of batteries and solar energy have fallen about 85 percent. The cost of wind power has dropped by 55 percent. “In some cases, costs have fallen below fossil fuels,” Skea said. The world is on pace for global average temperatures to rise roughly 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, compared with preindustrial times. World leaders during climate negotiations last year pledged to reduce emissions and target 1.5 degrees Celsius. Those ambitions now hang by a thread. To reach the world’s 1.5-degree goal, emissions need to peak by 2025 and then be reduced by about 43 percent by 2030, Skea said. Previous IPCC reports found stark differences in a world warmed, on average, by 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with 2 degrees. Exceeding 1.5 degrees could have irreversible impacts on ecosystems. Limiting warming would save about 4 inches of average sea level rise by 2100 and halve the number of species losing more than 50 percent of their habitat. “The longer the delay occurs, the more ambitious the reductions need to be to meet the 1.5,” Edmonds said. “Eventually emissions have to go to zero.” Globally, the world’s top 10 percent of households with the highest emissions per person are responsible for between 34-45 percent of all household greenhouse gas emissions. The bottom 50 percent of the global population contribute just 13-15 percent of all household emissions. Those findings are in line with a report on carbon inequality by the Stockholm Environment Institute, which found that the richest 1 percent of the world’s population are responsible for as much greenhouse gas output as twice the pollution of the poorest 3.1 billion people. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that lasts about 10-15 years in the atmosphere. To researchers, reducing methane represents low-hanging fruit that could have a big impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Capturing more methane from landfills, changing diets to consume less livestock and shoring up infrastructure that carries natural gas could help reduce its impact. “It’s a high leverage gas to go after, the technologies are there for that. You can tighten up natural gas transmission and distribution systems. That’s something that’s pretty cost effective,” Edmonds said. “If you have pipelines blow out, that’s money going up into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, there’s a lot of incentive to tighten those systems up.” Continuing to install new fossil fuel infrastructure without abatement will lock in greenhouse gas emissions, a summary of the report says. The typical use of the fossil fuel infrastructure that’s already constructed or planned would result in going beyond the 1.5 degree Celsius target. “Investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness,” Guterres said. Given the pace of the energy transition, investment in new fossil fuel equipment could lead to these assets becoming “stranded,” he added, meaning that they would lose their value before it can be financially realized. Carbon capture and storage technology could reduce the risk of stranding these assets, but a shift away from fossil fuels is necessary, the report says. \n",

              "'WASHINGTON — A federal judge indicated Wednesday that then-President Donald Trump\\'s remarks on Jan. 6 telling a crowd to \"fight like hell\" before the Capitol attack could have signaled to his supporters that he wanted them \"to do something more\" than just protest. In a court order for the case against Jan. 6 defendant Alexander Sheppard, U.S. District Court Judge John Bates ruled that Sheppard could not raise the \"public authority\" defense at trial after his lawyer argued Trump had authorized his client\\'s actions at the Capitol that day. Bates, who was appointed to the court by former President George W. Bush, rejected that argument, ruling that \"President Trump neither stated nor implied that entering the restricted area of the Capitol grounds and the Capitol building or impeding the certification of the electoral vote was lawful,\" and therefore a public authority defense was not viable. \"These words only encourage those at the rally to march to the Capitol — nothing more — and do not address legality at all. But, although his express words only mention walking down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, one might conclude that the context implies that he was urging protestors to do something more— perhaps to enter the Capitol building and stop the certification,\" Bates wrote. In a footnote, Bates noted that his ruling was not out of step with the Jan. 6 committee\\'s final report, which concluded that Trump acted \"corruptly\" because he knew stopping the certification was unlawful. His ruling was the first to cite the House panel\\'s report since it was made public last week. Bates further noted that phrases cited by the committee, such as “fight like hell,” could \"signal to protesters that entering the Capitol and stopping the certification would be unlawful.\" \"Thus, the conclusions reached here—that even if protesters believed they were following orders, they were not misled about the legality of their actions and thus fall outside the scope of any public authority defense — is consistent with the Select Committee’s findings,\" Bates wrote. He went on to say there was \"simply no indication\" that Trump informed the crowd that going into the Capitol would be legal. \"His speech simply suggests that it would be an act of \\'boldness\\' to \\'stop the steal,\\'\" Bates wrote. Several other defendants have tried to raise the public authority defense, including Danny Rodriquez, the MAGA-hatted Jan. 6 rioter who drove a stun gun into the neck of now-former Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone. The strategy of blaming Trump has not proven effective at trial. Dustin Thompson, who was convicted on all counts, had told a jury he was seeking Trump\\'s \"approval\" and that he thought he was \"following presidential orders.\" Thompson was sentenced to three years in federal prison for stealing a coat rack and a bottle of liquor while storming the Capitol. In a filing earlier this month in the Sheppard case, the Justice Department argued it was \"objectively unreasonable to conclude that President Trump or any other Executive Branch official could authorize citizens to engage in violent or assaultive conduct toward law enforcement officers and interfere with the Electoral College proceedings that were being conducted\" and that Trump\\'s speech did not advise Sheppard that his conduct was legal.'"

              "'Actress June Brown, who played the much-loved character Dot Cotton on EastEnders for more than three decades, has died at the age of 95. Her family said they were \"deeply saddened\" to announce that their \"beloved mother\" had died \"very peacefully\" at her home on Sunday. EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt described her as an \"incredible woman\". Dot Cotton was one of the BBC soap\\'s longest-running characters and a favourite with viewers. Brown first appeared in the series in 1985, the year EastEnders was created. She stayed until 1993, returning to play the same character from 1997 until 2020. An EastEnders spokesperson said: \"There are not enough words to describe how much June was loved and adored by everyone at EastEnders, her loving warmth, wit and great humour will never be forgotten. \"June created one of the most iconic characters in Dot Cotton, not just in soap but in British television, and having appeared in 2884 episodes, June\\'s remarkable performances created some of EastEnders finest moments.\" After Brown\\'s death was announced, many fans began sharing their favourite TV moment of hers - when the actress met Lady Gaga on the BBC\\'s Graham Norton show. One of EastEnders\\' best-known stars, Brown was in her late 50s when she joined Albert Square. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Dirty Den, suggested her for the role. Until then, Brown\\'s career had incorporated stage, film and television, with appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. Some of her biggest storylines included Nasty Nick\\'s murder plot, when her son, played by John Altman, planned to poison her so he could steal her big bingo winnings to use on drugs. He changed his mind at the last minute. One of her most moving and controversial moments came when her close friend Ethel, who was terminally ill, asked Dot to help her take an overdose of morphine to end her life. Dot wrestled with her Christian beliefs but ultimately decided to leave out morphine pills for Ethel to take. Her relationship with husband Jim Branning, played by the late John Bardon, was much cherished by fans of the soap. Brown remained a favourite with viewers for years, but during a podcast interview in February 2020, she confirmed that she had left the series \"for good\". In the last episode she featured in, Dot Cotton - or Dot Branning - left a voicemail message for another character, Sonia Fowler, saying she had moved to Ireland. Following the news of Brown\\'s death, Woodyatt - who played Ian Beale in the soap for 35 years - said in a statement: \"I\\'m lost for words, something June never was. \"So many memories, so much fun. Just purely and simply an incredible woman who had the most incredible life and career, I was fortunate to have shared a small part of it. They never made you a Dame (we did try), but to me you will always be Dame Brown.\" Gillian Taylforth, who plays Kathy Beale in the BBC soap, said: \"I\\'m truly heartbroken by this news. June Brown OBE, MBE, was an amazing woman and a truly wonderful actress. I shared many scenes with her over the years and she was always someone I looked up to and learnt from. There will never be another June Brown and I\\'m sending all my love to her family.\" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Brown was a \"true national treasure\". \"There was nobody quite like June Brown. She captured the zeitgeist of British culture like no other in her many years on our screens,\" she said. \"Today we\\'ve lost a true national treasure but my goodness what a life she has led. Rest in peace.\" EastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw said Brown was an \"iconic\" character both on and off screen. The BBC\\'s director-general Tim Davie said: \"June Brown was a brilliantly talented actor who was loved by millions.  Her performances as the incomparable Dot Cotton delivered some of the most memorable moments in soap history.\" \"Our thoughts are with her family and many friends.\" After she left the soap, Brown starred in a Christmas drama podcast in December 2020 as part of a series about family separation during the pandemic. She played the mother of a son with Down\\'s syndrome in the play, which explored the strains of the mother-son relationship during enforced isolation. Other tributes were paid by former EastEnders star and activist Michael Cashman, who played the UK\\'s first gay character in a soap opera, Colin Russell. He wrote: \"She took this country on an amazing journey and changed it for the better.\" Cashman has previously spoken about how Brown helped him get time off rehearsals so he could go to an anti-Section 28 protest in London in 1988. Actor and writer Stephen Fry also said Brown will be remembered \"as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally\". He tweeted: \"June Brown, amongst all her other wonderful human qualities and achievements, will be remembered as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally - especially during the darkest days of HIV/AIDS and Section 28... it was a privilege to know her.\" Comedian Mo Gilligan also posted on Twitter: \"If you grew up on an estate there was always a Dot Cotton. Absolute iconic character in EastEnders.\"'"

              "'Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said \"we will not rest until justice is done\", amid further evidence of continued atrocities in Ukraine. Distressing images of civilian bodies in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to international outrage over Russia\\'s actions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations\\' Human Rights Council. She has also pushed for tougher international sanctions on Russia. In a news conference in the Polish capital Warsaw, Ms Truss said: \"What we have seen in the streets of Irpin and Bucha are scenes that we will never forget. We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians.\" She added: \"We are clear, that after these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council\". A senior Westminster source has told the BBC the government is considering further action against Russian soldiers as individuals. Officials are looking at further sanctions that could target captains, majors and colonels in the Russian military. It is understood this additional pressure could also include looking at ways to hold Russian soldiers legally accountable. Mr Johnson has said the UK \"will not stand by whilst this indiscriminate and unforgivable slaughter takes place\". He added: \"We are working to ensure those responsible are held to account. We will not rest until justice is done.\" Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in the areas around Kyiv so far. Russia, without evidence, has said the photos and videos were \"a staged performance\" by Ukraine. Ms Truss reiterated the prime minister\\'s comments, saying that the UK \"will not rest until these criminals are brought to justice\". She said \"it\\'s very clear war crimes have taken place\" and the UK is taking \"the maximum approach on sanctions, nothing is off the table\". Ms Truss added that Nato needs to use a meeting this week to \"step up support\" and sanctions. She said these measures should include more countries banning Russian ships from ports, sanctions on more banks and other sectors. In addition to this, she said countries should set out a \"clear timetable\" for eliminating Russia energy use. Ms Truss met with Ukraine\\'s Foreign Secretary Dmytro Kuleba in Poland ahead of key G7 and Nato talks. Also speaking at the news conference in Warsaw, Mr Kuleba said: \"What you have seen, the horrors that we have seen in Bucha, are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine so far.\" The foreign secretary will also hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, on Tuesday. She has pledged a Â£10m civil society fund for Ukraine, including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence, following reports of Russian forces sexually assaulting people in Ukraine, as a way of terrorising the population. Ms Truss has said Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin \"is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy\". She said \"a tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine\\'s hand in negotiations\". She added the UK would do more \"to ramp up the pressure\" on Russia and \"keep pushing others to do more\". The BBC\\'s Reality Check team and BBC Monitoring have been investigating Russia\\'s claims about the killings carried out in Bucha. Ukraine has accused Russia of \"deliberate massacre\", but Russia has crticised \"a staged provocation\" by Ukraine. The Kremlin claims the evidence, seen by the BBC and several news outlets, is inaccurate on three grounds: On Sunday, Mr Johnson said Russia\\'s \"despicable attacks\" on innocent Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and Irpin were \"yet more evidence\" of war crimes. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly called Mr Putin a war criminal and has recently said he should face a trial over the killings in Bucha. Mr Biden said he was also seeking more sanctions against Russia over the atrocities. Mr Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the weekend. Following their conversation on Saturday evening, Mr Zelensky said there would be a \"new package\" of \"very, very tangible support\".'"
